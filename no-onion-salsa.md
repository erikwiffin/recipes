# No Onion Salsa

## Ingredients

* 1 hatch pepper
* 4 roma tomatos
* 1 oz of lime juice
* cumin seeds
* corriander seeds
* Red pepper flakes
* ground cumin
* ground corriander
* sugar
* salt

## Directions

1. Cut pepper and tomatos into chunks. Put on a pan with cumin seeds, corriander seeds, red pepper flakes, and some salt. Broil until the hatch pepper starts to blacken.
2. Put the cooked ingredients into food processor. Add lime juice, ground spices, sugar, and salt. Pulse until blended.

## Results

Ended up being a little bit too spicy. Leave off the red pepper flakes. Maybe add them slowly during the food processor step.
I'd like to swap the sugar for some kind of fruit, maybe pineapple?
