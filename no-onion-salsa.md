# No Onion Salsa

## Ingredients

* 1 hatch pepper
* ~10 cherry tomatos
* ~7 cherry tomatos
* 1/3 cup of lime juice
* cumin seeds
* ground corriander
* salt

## Directions

1. Cut pepper into chunks, tomatos in half. Put on a pan with cumin seeds and broil until the hatch pepper starts to blacken.
2. Chop the remaining tomatos. Put all tomatos and pepper into food processor. Add lime juice, corriander, and salt. Pulse until chopped.
3. Reduce in a pot until not so liquidy.


## Results

*Way* too lime-y. Go with maybe half an ounce next time. The extra tomatos and the reduction step probably wouldn't be necessary.
I also have corriander seeds, so I should have used those at the roasting step.
