## Ingredients

* Sesame oil
* 1/2 packet of WF Thai Curry powder
* 1 stalk of lemon grass, chopped into 2 inch segments, and unraveled
* 1lb yukon gold potato, cubed
* 1lb of boneless skinless chicken
* 1/2 zuchinni
* 1 large carrot
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1/2 cup of coconut milk
* 1 teaspoon fish sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* salt

## Directions

Boil water. Once the water has reached a boil, add the potatos. Boil until soft then rinse in a collander and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the curry powder and lemongrass. When you smell the aroma from the spices, add the chicken, cook. Add potatos, zucchini, carrots, and bell peppers into the pan, stir to combine well with the powder. Fry until the chicken is pretty close to cooked.

Add the coconut milk, water, and cover the pot with its lid. Let cook for about 3 minutes or until all the ingredients are cooked. Add the fish sauce, sugar, and salt. Stir to mix well with the curry. Turn off the heat and serve the curry immediately with rice noodles.

## Results

Resulting curry might have been a bit too thick, but I forgot the "cover the pot" step.
