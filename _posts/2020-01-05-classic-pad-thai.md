+ 6oz uncooked flat rice noodles
+ 1/4 cup rice vinegar
+ 4 teaspons sugar
+ 3 oz extra-firm tofu
+ 2 tablespoons banana pepper
+ 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
+ 1 tablespoon water
+ 1 tablespoon soy sauce
+ 1 tablespoon fish sauce
+ 1/8 tablespoon salt
+ 3 tablespoons peanut oil
+ 1 skinless boneless chicken thigh
+ 4 cups bean sprouts

+ 1/4 cup unsalted roasted peanuts

1. Prepare the noodles according to package directions; drain. 
2. Place tofu on several layers of heavy-duty paper towels; cover with additional paper towels. Let stand 20 minutes, pressing down occasionally.
3. Combine remaining 1 teaspoon sugar, lime juice, and next 3 ingredients (through fish sauce). Combine eggs and salt, stirring well.
4. Heat a large wok over high heat. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons oil; swirl to coat. Add garlic; stir-fry 15 seconds. Add chicken; stir-fry for 2 minutes or until browned. Add pressed tofu; cook for 1 minute on each side or until browned. Pour in egg mixture; cook 45 seconds or until egg begins to set around chicken and tofu. Remove from pan; cut into large pieces.
5. Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to wok; swirl to coat. Add 2 cups bean sprouts, green onions, and dried shrimp; stir-fry 1 minute. Add noodles and soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes, tossing until noodles are lightly browned. Add reserved egg mixture; toss to combine. Arrange remaining 2 cups bean sprouts on a platter; top with noodle mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts and cilantro. Serve with vinegar mixture.

## Notes

Results were okay, but a little bland. I skipped the banana peppers, but it needed *something* pickled, maybe carrots/raddishes next time? Hannah complained about too much fish sauce soaking into the tofu. Make sure *not* to stir the egg mixture.

I also forgot to use peanut oil and used vegetable oil instead. Peanut oil would be better.
