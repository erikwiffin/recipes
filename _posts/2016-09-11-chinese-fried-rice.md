## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* Sesame oil
* 4 eggs
* Some soy sauce
* 4tbsp soy sauce
* 1tbsp fish sauce
* Asafoetida powder
* 1tsp chinese five spice
* 1.5lb ground pork
* 1tbsp rice vinegar
* 2lb frozen peas and carrots
* 8 cups cooked rice (4 cups uncooked)
* A bunch of green onions
* 10oz bean sprouts

## Directions

Start cooking rice early.

Scramble eggs with a bit of soy sauce in them. I did it in two batches because my frying pan is small.

Heat olive oil in a big pot, once hot, add asafoetida and chinese five spice, then add ground pork. Cook pork, deglaze (didn't really need it, but whatever) with rice vinegar, add frozen veggies. Thaw/cook veggies with pork.

Add rice, green onions, bean sprouts to pot. Make sure everything is thoroughly mixed.

Add egg mixture to pot. Remove from heat. Add soy sauce and fish sauce. Make sure everything is thoroughly mixed.

## Results

Tasty, not too salty. Could stand to have a bit more flavor. Cooking in a pot is tricky, this would be a lot easier in a wok. The heat isn't evenly distributed and the bottom burned a little.
